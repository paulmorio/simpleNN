Simple Neural Network Implementation using basic Python for Instruction in Class

## Pre-requisites
Python, all versions 2.5x+ should work. Most of the code will be written for 2.7.12 however care has been put in so that it should run inside of 3.2+ with little to no alteration.

## Motivation
Reviewing Key Concepts and Preparing materials to teach in Class.

## Currently included:
For character level text generation.
- Vanilla Feed Forward MLP (with stochastic gradient descent, sigmoid activation layers, quadratic cost function)
- Vanilla Feed Forward MLP (with stochastic gradient descent, sigmoid activation layers, cross entropy cost function, softmax output, L2 regularization)
